I'm a Backend-Focused Software Engineer who loves building clean, scalable systems that donâ€™t just *work* â€” they drive real results. Currently at **Suprdense**, Iâ€™m tackling real-world engineering problems like CRM migrations, API integrations, and automation workflows that serve thousands of users. While Iâ€™m comfortable across the stack, backend architecture is where I thrive.
